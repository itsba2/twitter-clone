# Twitter Clone

This was a project that I have been thinking to implement for a while.

The aim was to work on and gain some front-end skills.

The page elements do not have any functionality, just visuals.

### Technologies Used

- React
- Talwind CSS

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
